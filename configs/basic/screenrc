# trick to use M-1 as the gnu screen prefix (source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1543427/gnu-screen-changing-the-default-escape-command-key-to-alt-x)
# set prefix to "C-?", but also set its "alias" to ~M-1~
escape ^@a

# use screen auxiliary register to save C-a into register S
register S ^@

# M-1 produces ^A and acts as an escape key
bindkey "^[1" process S

# bind ~[prefix] X~ to remove (:remove) current split region
bind X remove
